echo "(137) Summer Break 13.7 (Avery): Ken is creating hype advertisements for the upcoming Carmine contest. The girls think that Ken is going to be attacked by the conspirators as a weak point, but their suggestion of temporarily unmaking Ken is not well received."

echo "(138) Summer Break 13.8 (Verona): Verona has an argument with Lucy at her place. She leaves to see Jeremy and gets to relax a bit. She meets with Brett and David, decides she'll go back home and cope, decides to do the demesnes ritual, but can't do it right away."

The girls and a small army of goblins confront Raquel (and Wye) at Musser's cabin. Bluntmunch is not loyal, Gashwad is, but Gash told Edith stuff about the BHI. They call Nicolette about it."

echo "(140) Summer Break 13.B1 (Interlude - Ray): Raymond struggles as acting headmaster. He pays Charles a visit in his cell, but something is up. Maricica hits the BHI and frees Charles, using Seth as a pawn. The Kennet trio arrives too late."

The Kennet Others meet, and Bluntmunch is ousted as a pawn of Maricica and Edith. Lucy's mom is on a date with the Beautiful Man, Miss will handle that. The Kennet Arena will be the venue of the contest for the role of Carmine."

echo "(142) Summer Break 13.B2 (Interlude - John): John packs up his house and says goodbye to some of the Kennet Others. He is confronted by the trio en route to the Carmine contest at the Kennet Arena, and delayed by each in turn. Ultimately he refuses their bids to stay safe and become Lucy's familiar and, with the Judges' blessing, unbinds his Dog mates to assist him, setting the terms of the contest."

echo "(143) Summer Break 13.11 (Lucy): Lucy receives some comfort from Zed and Brie in the wake of John's decision, before she goes up against some Witch Hunters, with perimeter spirits Smoulder and Engine Head as backup. Verona and Avery drop by to help, and despite the trio holding their own against a pair of Witch Hunter, it's clear the girls are out of sync. Musser shows up, and informs the girls that he's already put out a call-- Practitioners are coming to Kennet to 'clean house'."

echo "(144) Summer Break 13.B3 (Interlude - Alabaster): The Alabaster reflects on the contradictions and paradoxes of her existence as she watches the Carmine contest unfold. John fights and defeats the ephemeral beast Ondvarg and his pack, with one ephemeral bird escaping the fight unnoticed. New candidate Lauren Snyder enters the arena, and candidates Faceful and Breasbiter fight to the death (with Breastbiter victorious). The Alabaster leaves the arena to chastise Lucy and Avery for blocking the doors, and tells them that Charles has arrived in Kennet."

echo "(145) Summer Break 13.12 (Verona): Verona has a heart-to-heart with Raquel, fights some Witch Hunters outside the arena, and is reprimanded by the Sable for blocking the way to the contest (which the Witch Hunters then promptly enter). The trio meet up with Guilherme for some final gifts, and run off to find Maricica. They find Lis instead, and discover that she has expanded her range to all of Kennet, taking over Ken's role as city spirit."

echo "(146) Summer Break 13.B4 (Interlude - Cagerattler-Frances-Plath): The Witch Hunters have joined the Carmine contest. We get contestant Cagerattler's backstory and perspective before he is defeated by Cleo's crew. The perspective switches to Francis, who watches as Cleo and some other Witch Hunters are taken apart by klmgrhrtnplath, before being allowed to leave the arena with the surviving WHs. Lastly, we get tykmnfgjnplath's perspective as he prepares to face off against Lauren Snyder; but she is shot by Francis through a crack in the arena wall before the fight begins. Her secret is revealed, so horrifying that rtnbrqwkjplath chooses to die rather than continue the fight."

echo "(147) Summer Break 13.13 (Avery): The girls have to decide whether to try to rescue Brie, who has been kidnapped by Maricica for the Choir's power, or to try to protect the Carmine furs, which are accessible to the conspirators via new city-spirit Lis. They run to the furs, but they're too late. The girls fight both Bluntmunch's fresh Dog Meat and Lis's interference as they race through Kennet to intercept Charles. The conspirators and the trio + Kennet Others face off outside the arena. Charles is able to sway Musser to join his side, which proves enough to turn the tide-- Charles enters the Carmine Contest. Maricica flits off, but before she leaves, she destroys Brie's bindings and releases the Hungry Choir, revealing that Charles is now able to control it using Yalda's cursed doll. Avery runs to try to get Yalda's ring to John, but the Ephemeral Bird swoops in, snatching it from her hands at the pivotal moment."

echo "(148) Summer Break 13.B5 (Interlude - John): Lauren Snyder sacrifices herself so that John can defeat her demonic familiar.

After a tense wait, the Carmine Contest concludes, and the Judges exit the arena accompanied by John's remaining soldiers...and the newly-risen Carmine Exile."

echo "(150) Fall Out 14.1 (Avery): Avery moves into Thunder Bay. 'Welcome' committee Ann and Deb get her set up to meet the local Lord and the city's council, where Avery argues for why she should be allowed to stay in the city and is granted a probationary residency. We learn that Charles has begun his reign of terror, Gainsaying Practitioner children and old enemies."

echo "(151) Fall Out 14.2 (Lucy): Lucy, still very much not okay after the events of the end of Summer, sees to some of the perimeter shrines (where she learns that Lis may be interfering with the perimeter), accompanied by John's old squad. She then attends her first day of school, only to find that Innocents are fleeing Kennet, shrinking the number of students. Verona never makes it to school. Lucy meets briefly with the Kennet Others, and later sees the now-freed Edith, who we learn has been terrorizing Matthew in his own home since she was released."

echo "(152) Fall Out 14.3 (Verona): Verona leaves a body double in her place while she explores Kennet's new Knotted underworld, accompanied by Tashlit and Peckersnot.

echo "(153) Fall Out 14.4 (Avery): Avery goes to school and discovers that some of her new friends are LGBT. She's asked by Deb to investigate a new Practitioner in the area, Franky, who she learns has been not-quite-Awakened by the Carmine Exile, seemingly set up to create a mess that would take out some of Musser's allies."

echo "(154) Fall Out 14.5 (Verona): Verona goes to (upper-Kennet) school, and recharges some with Sir and friends. Later, Miss alerts her to trouble in the Undercity, and Lucy tags along to help Verona deal with the situation. Things are tense between the two friends, and Verona ultimately loses her temper, sending Lucy away before dealing with the threat by herself."

echo "(155) Fall Out 14.6 (Lucy): Lucy deals with normal school life, worried about Verona leaving the fetch in her place more and more in favor of handling the Undercity, and Jeremy confides in her that he's feeling upset about being ignored by the fake Verona. Lucy visits Rook (along with some other Kennet Others) and discusses the plan going forward, as well as receiving some sage advice from Rook. Lucy deals with some Undercity denizens plaguing Innocent Kennet, and hands them off to Verona to handle, before heading to Guilherme's cave to visit him for the first time after his fall to Winter. Finally, all three girls meet in a dream, and try to find a way forward together."

echo "(156) Fall Out 14.z (Interlude - Basil Winters): Basil Winters visits Musser at the BHI, and a group of Practitioners plot together to take over all of the Carmine Exile's domain with Lordships. They do several in a row before the Carmine intervenes, Gainsaying Milly Legendre before she can complete her ritual. Basil steps in, and although he appears to succeed in claiming the territory, Rook tricked Basil during the Lordship challenges, and unbeknownst to Musser's allies, Bridge is now the true Lord."

echo "(157) Playing a Part 15.1 (Verona): Verona deals with her dad as their social worker looks on with concern. Things go about as well as can be expected. Verona later rescues Matthew from a fight with Edith, who is still trying to get Matthew to give their marriage another chance. The duo head together to the Undercity to deal with some escaped Others, and commiserate over their difficult home situations."

echo "(158) Playing a Part 15.2 (Avery): Avery's phone call with Liberty is interrupted when she's summoned by the Lord of Thunder Bay, who asks her to look into council members Florin, Hugh Legendre, Odis's apprentice Thea, and Thomas Whitt, who the Lord suspects are plotting with Musser. In her Innocent life, Avery confronts her new friend Jeannine about her lack of respect for boundaries, and spends some more time with her other new friend, Nora. Avery spies on Florin, listens to a drum solo in Nora's garage, and reflects on how hard it's becoming to juggle all of the people in her life."

echo "(159) Playing a Part 15.3 (Lucy): Lucy says goodbye to Wallace before his surgery, and runs into some Undercity refugees at school (Bracken and younger brother). Lucy, Verona, and Miss discuss the ramifications for Kennet of allowing Knotted people to live in the Overcity, the logistics of Verona's planned weekend away to visit Avery, and the looming threat of the Family Man's Undercity cult. 
"

echo "(160) Playing a Part 15.4 (Avery): Verona arrives in Thunder Bay (reuniting Cherrypop and Snowdrop), and she and Avery discuss options for preventing Kennet from Knotting further. Verona opens up to Avery a bit, meets the Thunder Bay council, and has an awkward dinner with her mother and Avery's family. The chapter concludes with Avery discovering Verona in the bathroom, crippled by her chronic pain. Verona confides in Avery that her injury may be permanent"

echo "(161) Playing a Part 15.5 (Verona): We get a very depressing look into Verona's mental state as she mostly fails to cope with her current life situation and quietly sinks deeper into a bleak spiral. She and Avery work together to summon some new Lost: Ratko the Wrongdoer, Sootsleeves, a living song, and the Tearaway Kid. Their new allies let them know that Thea is planning to kidnap some children"

echo "(162) Playing a Part 15.6 (Lucy): Lucy hangs out with Mia, before being summoned by Rook to help deal with Marlen, who is on her way to meet with Basil, where she will likely uncover Rook's ploy. Lucy's mom tries to stop her, but Lucy manages to sneak out with Bracken, Montague, Doe, Toadswallow, and Reggie to intercept Marlen. The Kennet Others try to help, but things go awry, and Marlen flees into the Undercity, where she is brought under the protection of the Family Man, who appears to be in the midst of making a deal with the Bitter Street Witch"

echo "(163) Playing a Part 15.7 (Avery): We get some more details on Sootsleeve's past life on the Paths, before Avery and Verona disguise themselves in order to enter the magic item Thea has positioned to trap some children. Things seem deceptively fun and okay in Thea's world, but Avery suspects something is off. Things come to a head when Avery gives one of the children her escape key to present to Thea, who gets extremely angry and traps Avery and Verona in the magic item. She reveals that she was planning to 'clip the wings' of the childrens' souls, and Avery and Verona prepare to face off against both Thea and the Other that inhabits the magic item, the Ornithologist. "

echo "(164) Playing a Part 15.8 (Verona): Verona and Avery fight the Ornithologist and successfully escape. They break into Thea's vault, where she has trapped some of the children, and Avery and Verona break them out one by one. Before breaking out of the vault itself, they damage Thea's setup and steal a major power source. As they leave, they overhear Thea talking to Hugh-- she reveals that she has ties to Musser, and seems to think that it was Witch Hunters, rather than the girls, that tried to sabotage her. "

echo "(165) Playing a Part 15.9 (Lucy): Lucy and the Kennet Others intervene as the Bitter Street Witch and the Family Man attempt to join forces. They manage to pull the Witch aside, where she reveals that she has no intention of joining forces with the Family Man, but thought that letting him think she wanted to deal with him would buy her some reprieve. She uses her oracle powers to tell Lucy and the Kennet Others where they can find and capture Marlen later that day, and agrees to cooperate with Kennet Above, with the condition that the Kennet Others try to kill the Family Man sooner rather than later. When negotiations resume, the Family Man offers a deal that is enticing not for the Witch but for her lieutenants, sewing tension in her ranks. Lucy and the Kennet Others successfully capture Marlen later that day, but Lucy is very uncomfortable with the amount of killing required to secure their win. Finally, a number of the Family Man's ranks appear in Kennet Above, claiming to want sanctuary. "

echo "(166) Playing a Part 15.10 (Lucy): Lucy calls Tymon to get advice on what to do about the Family Man, before meeting some of the Kennet Others in Nibble and Chloe's factory to figure out what to do with their new prisoner. Marlen seems reluctant (or unable) to swear the oaths that would secure her freedom, and tries unsuccessfully to escape. Lucy then has a heart-to-heart with Bracken, before joining Grandfather in taking down a group of the Family Man's men, who were waiting to be signalled by the 'refugees' being hosted by Kennet Above"

echo "(167) Playing a Part 15.11 (Lucy): The Family Man's forces attack Kennet Above, and Lucy does her best to protect the school (with the help of Bracken and Melissa) before heading into Kennet proper to fight some invading Others. Verona arrives in Kennet in the midst of the fighting, and she and Lucy work together to defend their town and come up with a plan to deal with the Family Man. They carry out that plan together the following day, crippling the Family Man both physically and spiritually"

echo "(168) Playing a Part 15.z (Interlude - Gilkey): Gilkey is sent to fetch Avery for a council meeting, and we get a window into Gilkey's constant struggle to exist as a creature that inherently poisons everything around him. He's touched by Avery's guilelessness in their encounter. At the meeting itself, Thea is enraged at the attack on her vault, and while she seems to suspect Avery, the rest of the council dismisses her concerns. After being given an additional mission by the Lord, Gilkey makes a stop at his old home, resting among the poisoned remains of the family of the man he once was, before heading to a Dark Fall market, where he encounters none other than Maricica. She manipulates him into killing a beast that's been pursuing her (preventing her from finding sanctuary or rest since arc 13), but not before he poisons her wings, taking her flight"

echo "(169) Left in the Dust 16.1 (Verona): We flash back to before the Family Man's takedown. Verona and Lucy talk the Kennet council into allowing outside Practitioners back into Kennet, before inviting the Foreman, the Bitter Street Witch, and the Vice Principal to the table. The Witch and Vice Principal agree to cooperate and stop expanding their territories in exchange for certain boons, but the Foreman only agrees to help take down the Family Man, for a price. Later, Liberty and Nicolette arrive in the Undercity. Nicolette meets with a Bitter Street Witch, and they seem to hit it off. Liberty and Toadswallow have a slight disagreement over her father's nature. The chapter closes with Toadswallow's debut of his new goblin market, and a warning from both Nicolette and the Witch that the girls will have to deal with Lis if they want to make any headway in growing and shaping Kennet."

echo "(170) Left in the Dust 16.2 (Avery): Avery spies on Tomas Whitt and discovers he plans to bring weapons into Thunder Bay via Anthem Tedd, in order to strike a truce with Witch Hunters. Liberty and Nicolette come to town, and Liberty meets Avery's family before the two head out to town, where they run into Nora."

echo "Left in the Dust 16.3 (Avery-Nora): Liberty, Nora, and Avery have a heart-to-heart around a campfire; we learn more about Nora's past, and Avery and Liberty butt heads over Anthem Tedd. Later, Liberty and Avery run the Build Up Path with Jude and some other Garricks, and Avery negotiates for Edeline the City Bird Rider to be set free to fly off into the sunset with the Tearaway Kid. Finally, Nora visits Avery and confesses her feelings for her, and the two girls decide to enter a relationship, although Nora isn't ready to be out yet. We learn that Liberty is bisexual and interested in Avery, but that she allowed Nora to take her shot first."

echo "(172) Left in the Dust 16.4 (Lucy): Lucy and Verona visit Marlen in captivity and thwart her many escape attempts. The two girls then head off to collect some allies before confronting Lis. They meet Guilherme and Miss in the Fae cave, where Miss admits that she's been considering leaving Kennet. Guilherme, Grandfather, Tashlit, and Matthew tag along afterwards. Before the group can speak to Lis, Charles appears and Gainsays both Verona and Lucy (despite Verona's best efforts). Verona later reveals her plan to create a Lost version of Kennet, with Miss and Founder."

echo "(173) Left in the Dust 16.5 (Verona): The trio and friends begin negotiations with the conspirators. It goes just okay. Later, Tashlit tells Verona she doesn't want to be her Familiar just yet. Verona isn't ready to hear her explanation, and takes solace in Jeremy for the evening. The Kennet council, Undercity leaders, and some Aware meet in dream to discuss their plan for Miss to Found a Lost Kennet."

echo "(174) Left in the Dust 16.6 (Lucy): We see a series of upsetting scenes from Lucy's past, before joining Lucy and Bracken as they receive their first joint combat lesson from Guilherme, while Melissa looks on. Lucy heads to visit Verona, who's working on Alchemy and preparing for her Demesne ritual, then stops by the Undercity to meet some of the friends Toadswallow brought in to help set up his market. Rook gives Lucy some sage advice on her way out, and finally, Lucy visits Wallace, who is back in town, and forgives him for not contacting her while he was away."

echo "(175) Left in the Dust 16.7 (Verona): Verona argues with Bret, before joining Lucy and Mallory at the House on Half Street to do some Summoning work in preparation for her Demesne ritual. Later, Verona studies with Jeremy, before spending the night clearing out the Undercity's version of her soon-to-be Demesne. The next morning, Miss arrives to tell Verona that she should begin the ritual, and Verona makes her claim to the House on Half Street of Kennet Below, Kennet Above, and the Kennet yet to be."

echo "(176) Left in the Dust 16.8 (Avery): Avery spies on Florin, and learns that he's planning to oust the Lord of Thunder Bay to become Lord himself. He tries to sway her to his side by offering incentives and reasoning, but Avery is unconvinced. After hanging out briefly with Nora and meeting her family, she tells the Lord about Florin's plans. Later, Avery gets the text from Verona that the Demesne ritual is starting. At the same time, things start to kick off with Florin's Lordship claim. Avery rushes to meet with the Thunder Bay council, and while not everyone is willing to help defend the city, Avery, Deb, Ann, and the Lord face off against BHI mom Mrs. Ferguson, who is working with Florin and has called a Storm to Thunder Bay. Then, Avery confronts Florin directly, and manages to trap him on a Path. She then runs off to play her part in helping distract Musser's forces while Verona claims her Demesne."

echo "(177) Left in the Dust 16.9 (Verona): Verona kicks off her Demesne claim in the Undercity. The Vice Principal, Mallory, the Bitter Street Witch, and Matthew all show up to give her their blessing, although the echoes of the house's previous inhabitants give her some trouble. The Foreman won't give in without a fight, and after a brief brawl between Lucy and the Foreman's champion, none other than the Family Man shows up, taking the Foreman down. The Family Man becomes Verona's final Undercity challenger, with Verona scraping a victory in a one-on-one duel. Finally, the Carmine Exile appears to inform Verona that the other Judges have reached a verdict on how she can attempt to assert her Claim over a space that doesn't exist."

echo "(178) Left in the Dust 16.10 (Verona): The Judges tell Verona that she must eventually claim her Demesne in Lost Kennet or be Forsworn. Worse, if Verona fails to claim her final Demesne, the ritual to create Lost Kennet fails with it. The Judges also challenge Verona's current claim, questioning the morality of the people she calls allies, and questioning her commitment (while wearing Bret's face). Tashlit, the Ghouls, Reggie, Montague, Jabber, Guilherme, some Goblins, and Cig all declare no contest. When Miss and Toadswallow come, Verona confronts them over the visions the Judges showed her, even suggesting Toadswallow should step down as Kennet council leader. Unexpectedly, Anthem Tedd arrives to challenge the claim, angry that Liberty left her visit with Avery in tears. However, a call from America convinces him to back down. Verona succeeds in her claim for Kennet Below and Above, but Anthem sticks around to inform the girls that Musser has just claimed Toronto."

echo "(179) Left in the Dust 16.y (Interlude - Milly): We follow Milly as she grows up, watching her first traumatic experience with goblins as well as her impassioned attempt to get a room in BHI's west wing. Skipping to the present, we see Milly managing her new Lordship, banishing all of the area's goblins and crying after seeing the ignoble end of a very old Sealer in her Realm. Later, some friends (America, Fernanda, Sullivan Musser) and foes (Avery and her Thunder Bay allies) come to visit as Milly tends to one of her family's older bindings. Milly strikes a deal with the Beorgmann, a long-bound child-stealing Other, in order to fend off the attack on her territory. Despite the deal, she ends up forfeiting her Lordship. In the aftermath, Musser's allies recover from having lost seven territories in one night, and Bridge, as Basil Winters, makes his move."

echo "(180) Left in the Dust 16.z (Interlude - Queen-Cassandra-Kitty-Bridge): We follow a Bugge named the Turtle Queen as she gains power before being bound by Basil Winters (and later unbound by Rook). Our perspective leaps to the Countdown Cassandra and the Typetap Kitty as we watch a collection of Basil's bound Others attack Musser's allies. In the aftermath, we watch through Bridge's eyes as Avery and Rook butt heads over Rook's use of body snatching on the captured Practitioners."

echo "(181) Gone and Done It 17.1 (Lucy): The trio meet in dream to discuss their plans for Found Kennet, and Lucy quietly reflects on her reservations working with the morally gray Kennet Others. We see Lucy later in her sparring lessons with Guilherme, where she is turned into a beast and pushed to give Bracken a beatdown in front of Melissa and Bag. Lucy tells Melissa why Verona has been avoiding her. Later, in the Undercity, Lucy has a brief altercation with Kilwagon, a surprisingly reasonable Bogeyman. Afterwards, Bubbleyum warns Lucy that if she keeps coming to the Undercity to impose more rules on people, the denizens could turn on her. Finally, Lucy visits Louise, and reveals that she intends to nominate her for head of the Kennet Council."

echo "(182) Gone and Done It 17.2 (Avery): Avery and Thea work together to attempt to take one of Musser's Lordships. They fail, but take two prisoners in the process. Odis meets them afterwards and insists Avery take a ride on his bus line, during which he reveals that he knows she was the one who raided Thea's vault. Thea is furious, but Odis compels her to stand down and agree to cooperate with Avery and take no revenge. He also gives Avery some sage advice on the current situation in the region, telling her that she'll have to compromise with Musser eventually."

echo "(183) Gone and Done It 17.3 (Verona): The Kennet council debates its new leadership. After some contentious argument (during which Edith storms off), they decide on a joint leadership of Miss and Louise, pending the formation of Kennet Found. After the ritual, the council would become a three-pronged government: Miss to lead lost Kennet and the Others, Louise for Kennet Above and the humans, and the warlords of the Undercity for Kennet Below. Afterwards, Verona invites Jeremy to her Demesne, where he tells her he's been asked on a date. He offers to date Verona instead, and when Verona holds firm to not wanting to be his girlfriend, Jermey ends their friendship. Upset in the aftermath, Verona pays Jeremy one last visit in cat form."

echo "(184) Gone and Done It 17.4 (Lucy): Lucy goes on a date with Wallace, before they're met with a surprise 'welcome home' party at Wallace's house, where Lucy has a small argument with Mia, and Wallace's mom is very anxious throughout. Small things bug Lucy as she goes about her life-- Wallace says his mom was 'fussy' after talking to Lucy, and Lucy privately wonders if she might be racist, Mr. Bader is acting like she doesn't exist, Lucy's still thinking about how Mia isn't always the nicest, and Verona is isolating herself. Lucy has her first training session with Bubbleyum, and gets some advice from her afterwards. Finally, Lucy tackles multiple problems at once by inviting her entire class to the Undercity Arcade, connecting Kennet Above to Kennet Below, drawing Verona out of hiding, and resolving the long-standing feud between Mia and Hailey."

echo "(185) Gone and Done It 17.5 (Avery): Florin visits Avery after school. He explains that he's been exiled from Thunder Bay, but leaves Avery with a business card and a promise of one future favor. Afterwards, Avery hangs out with Nora, and the two have an important conversation about their relationship, during which Nora agrees that she won't ask too many questions about the secrets Avery is keeping, for now. Avery goes home to have a brief discussion with her mom about handling her family when they all visit Kennet for Thanksgiving, and afterwards Avery meets with Miss; the two discuss which path Miss should use as a jumping-off place to create Kennet Found, finally settling on the Stuck-In Place."

echo "(186) Gone and Done It 17.6 (Avery): Avery returns home to a crowded, noisy house, before joining Verona and Lucy in Verona's Demesne to discuss the Founding ritual. They call the Garricks, who are equal parts horrified and impressed by the girls' plan, and offer their expertise to help the ritual go smoothly. The girls visit Louise to tell her about the one major piece missing from the ritual: they need three pillars to stabilize Kennet, and they only have two (the council seat and Verona's Demesne). Matthew, though, has a solution, and begins the ritual to claim his house as a Demesne."

echo "(187) Gone and Done It 17.7 (Verona): Verona adjusts to life in her Demesne, discovers that her Fetch may be developing a sense of self, and bonds with Avery's cousins (Breanne and Kyle; later joined by Mallory) while Avery frets over Verona's mental state. Later, Verona visits Matthew's ritual to give her 'no contest' to his claim (as Edith hovers outside and dreams of their future together). The chapter closes as Lucy and Verona start to prepare the Found Kennet ritual, taking note of Musser's forces beginning to gather in Kennet."

echo "(188) Gone and Done It 17.a (Interlude - Elizabeth Driscoll): Prompted by a run-in with Sootsleeves and the Turtle Queen, Elizabeth Driscoll explains the situation surrounding Kennet to the group of Musser's allies that she's traveling with. After a brief call with her father about whether helping Musser is for the best, Elizabeth and Co head to Kennet to investigate on Musser's behalf (and hopefully free Marlen while they're at it); they're joined by Eloise Duchamp. Elizabeth visits Matthew's Demesne claim and attempts to set up a negotiation with the trio, but Matthew, unimpressed by her prejudice towards Others, decides she's not worth reasoning with. Kennet's denizens start to push back against the invaders, and Musser's allies are thrown into chaos. Lucy arrives, giving Elizabeth a chance to back down, but Elizabeth doubles down on the wrong side."

echo "(189) Gone and Done It 17.b (Interlude - Eloise): In flashbacks, we see a young Eloise make the decision between excelling in her family or being seen as a failure, her only alternatives to being entirely subsumed. Later flashbacks show Eloise meeting her Familiar, and we also see Musser offering Eloise the Lordship of Toronto for her family, in exchange for invading Kennet.

Kennet's group causes a car full of Practitioners to crash, gets a Hennigar arrested, and captures Elizabeth, who is then imprisoned in Matthew's basement.

Avery and Jude take a dangerous shortcut through the Burning Daylight and Watched Way to join Miss in the Stuck-In place, where they rescue her from three Wunderkand Finders.

The girls split up to notify Kennet of the truce, and Lucy retrieves her mother. Together, the girls and Jasmine watch Musser address his allies and leave Kennet with his chosen ten.

The girls hand out presents, Lucy is approached by the mayor of Kennet, and Nora draws some questionable conclusions about the secrets Avery is keeping from her. Later that night, Avery gets a message from Raquel and immediately travels to meet with her. She finds Raquel hopeless and downtrodden, sworn into an arranged marriage despite her uncle's downfall. Avery takes her to visit the Alabaster, and when the Alabaster refuses to help, Charles steps in, instructing Raquel to Forswear herself, and then undoing that Forswearing to free her of her engagement oath. Avery returns home to find that Sheridan has discovered evidence of Avery's magic, and is demanding answers. "

echo "(241) Let Slip 20.b (Interlude - Freeman): Freeman and Adrian, astrally projected, work together to handle a Practice-infused truck. On their way back to their bodies, Adrian strays from the course, gets into trouble, and panics. Freeman saves him, but is privately deeply frustrated at Adrian's tendency to shut down under pressure. As Adrian recovers from his ordeal, Freeman tells him about his own traumatic introduction to Practice. Later, Freeman and Adrian meet with Nomi, Harri, Yiyun and Helen, and the three mentors discuss Freeman's difficulties in teaching Adrian. They get a call from the rest of the St. Victor's group, and the full St. Victor's contingent meets at one of Musser's properties, currently housing the Whitt family. The kids attack the property, drive most of the Whitts out, loot the place, and burn down the building before they go."

echo "(242) Let Slip 20.c (Interlude - Connor Kelly): Connor and Kelsey Kelly enjoy the Christmas party. They make plans to handle their various responsibilities for the night before saying their goodbyes to the partygoers. On the walk home, Connor reflects on his and Kelsey's history together and the rough patches they've been through. The pair attend to their various dependents and head to bed. In the early morning, Connor finds Sheridan awake, fretting over video footage she took of Avery doing magic and pushing for an explanation. Connor, Kelsey, Sheridan, Rowan, and Avery have a family meeting, where Avery reveals her magic to her older siblings. Sheridan immediately wants to Awaken, and the family discusses their options as the confrontation with Charles looms closer."

echo "(243) Let Slip 20.7 (Verona): Alpeana leads Verona to the deep ruins to carry out a ritual that lets her connect with the customers who bought her books. Charles arrives to ensure that Verona isn't making moves against him, and also offers her a chance to surrender. Back at her dad's house, Verona meets two new renters that are moving in, who immediately start making lewd comments about her. When her dad won't budge on renting out the basement to them, Verona calls CAS. In her Demesne, Verona helps Raquel get settled in and struggles a bit internally to get along with her. Later, Verona, Sylvia, the Kellys, the Ellingsons, and Nora meet up at Yeast Inception, and the people in the know privately discuss the Kelly kids' newfound Awareness. Nicolette calls to inform the girls about the attack on the Chase family, and does a reading at Verona's request that confirms that, when the time comes, the girls will be on the same page."

echo "(244) Let Slip 20.8 (Lucy): Lucy and Verona visit Sootsleeve's Hold, meeting with Miss, Rook, Sootsleeves, Turtle Queen, and Montague to debrief the St. Victor's situation. The Turtle Queen warns them that the St. Victor's Practitioners plan to attack the Belangers, and the girls call Nicolette to figure out what to do. Lucy, Verona, Montague, and the Turtle Queen decide to go to the Belanger family's settlement to help them fend off the attack, and though the Belangers refuse to accept the support, Gillian and Jen are willing to strategize with them. The attackers arrive, Lucy gets karma on the Kenneteers' side by forcing the attackers to deal the first blow, and everything is thrown into chaos. "

echo "(245) Let Slip 20.d (Interlude - Jen): Jen navigates the battlefield and is steadily driven mad by the Abyssal scream, before Lucy and Verona show her how to block out the sound. She leaves Gillian with Verona and heads to the family storeroom, hoping to get power she can use to spread the sound-cancelling Practice to more people. After some argument, she and some higher ranking family members work together to fight back against the attackers. Some of the St. Victor's Practitioners and mentors arrive in the storeroom, and Lenard summons an Abyssal entity that badly injures the Belangers, before Lucy arrives, driving him away. Joshua stays behind, but before Lucy can confront him about the harm he's caused, he takes the out Charles gave him at his Awakening, returning to Innocence. As the dust settles, Jen realizes that Gillian is missing."

echo "(246) Let Slip 20.e (Interlude - Gillian): Gillian spends time with the Belanger circle, and struggles with the social interaction, feeling especially nervous around the Bitter Street Witch, who drops by with Nicolette. Much later, while the Belanger settlement is under attack, Gillian helps Verona and Julette defend her home. She watches Lucy and Verona go head to head with the invaders, and sees Seth, Helen, Cameron, and Harri trying to take advantage of the distraction to break into a building. She confronts the group, and a fight breaks out, which ends with Helen horror-ifying Gillian. Gillian's world explodes, and she finds Montague in the chaos, who tries to help her do as little damage to herself as possible in her new form. The Belanger circle arrives and tries to figure out how to save her, but they quickly realize that the only viable option is to transfer Gillian's curse to someone else. One by one, all present either refuse or are eliminated as options, with Tanner, Gillian's would-be betrothed, even abandoning the scene. Finally, it's Chase who steps forward to take on the curse. "

echo "(247) Let Slip 20.9 (Avery): Avery and Nora share a sweet moment in the woods that turns sour when Avery tells Nora that she might be absent in the new year, and can't give her any explanation. Dejected at their falling out, Avery runs some errands, passing through the Rolling Aisles, a Path that goes worse than expected. She stops by Kennet to pick up Snowdrop and gets a rundown on Cherrypop's slide, then touches base with the Garricks, picking up Jude while she's there and fending off an explosive Path mishap. Avery and Jude then visit several of Kennet's Market partners to renegotiate contracts. Later, Avery meets Lucy and Verona at the destroyed Belanger compound. They encourage Nicolette to step up as a leader in the family, and get an update on Chase and Gillian. Back home, Avery learns that her Path fast-traveling has caused the family's cell phone plan to be cut. She later attends a Thunder Bay council meeting to ask the local leadership for permission to Awaken her family, where she's met with resistance, although Ann and Deb change their tune when Avery reveals the power and celebrity she's recently stumbled into. Finally, the trio meets with the St. Victor's group to attend Edith's spirit surgery."

echo "(248) Let Slip 20.f (Interlude - Kyra-Lynn): Kyra-Lynn heads to the spirit surgery, and is continually frustrated with the people around her, who she finds lacking. Edith and the girls arrive, and Teddy and the other kids joke around while Griffin and Kyra-Lynn interview Edith, with the trio supervising. Kyra-Lynn leaves to center herself before the ritual, and Verona follows her; the two get into a heated argument about the morality of both of their approaches to fixing the world, which ends with Verona playing a video of a Horrified Chase. The ritual goes forward, and even with the girls keeping a close eye on things, Kyra-Lynn manages to secretly instruct Adrian to create a replica of the spirit surgery diagram in the next room. She steps away from the ritual, and coerces Stefan into agreeing to spirit surgery, announcing her plans to alter other kids as well, including herself. Lis reveals that the plan is to kill Edith during the ritual. "

echo "(249) Let Slip 20.z (Interlude - Julette): Julette explores Edith's Alcazar with Avery, Yiyun, Nomi, and the Alcazar's representation of the body of Edith James. In flashbacks, Julette banters with Guilherme and hangs out with Melissa. In the present, the explorers fight wraiths and echoes in the Alcazar, before realizing Giffin has sealed them inside; Nomi reveals Charles's faction may have turned on her and Yiyun because she didn't support the plan to Horrify the Belanger children. A wraith traps the group inside Matthew's slate-filled home, which starts to burn down. Julette proposes an escape plan, and Edith manages to manipulate the Alcazar to let them break out, down into the ritual's Abyssal heart and out to the outside world. Yiyun confronts her allies over the direction things have gone, and pushes them to agree to terms of combat with the girls. She recuses herself and Nomi from the upcoming conflict, pledging to take any kids with her who don't want to be part of this. A fight then breaks out. Kyra-Lynn murders the representation of the body of Edith James, and blows Julette to pieces (she later reforms as a cat). The trio subdue Kyra-Lynn before the Carmine Exile arrives; he starts to Gainsay them, but Lucy delays him while Avery's Promenade boon helps them to escape onto a Path, leaving Kennet behind."
